# WebDevLearning

What I've done to learn by myself web development. Before creating this repository, I've known a little about Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, Wordpress, PHP, Jekyll). I've learned them all just by practising. That's why I decide to learn about Web Developement more methodically. I've started with [the path WD on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/).
